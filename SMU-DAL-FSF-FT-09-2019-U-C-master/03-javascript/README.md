# Unit 3: JavaScript

## Overview
We’ve reached an important milestone in our journey: learning to code. This unit will introduce you to the fundamental programming concepts required to solve any computational problem. While the focus of this course is JavaScript, these fundamental concepts can be applied to any programming language. After gaining mastery of JavaScript, it will be relatively easy to learn a second (or third… or fourth...) language.

For our web applications to be interactive, we need a means for responding to user actions in the browser. JavaScript is _the_ programming language of the web. Every major browser, such as Firefox or Chrome, ships with a built-in JavaScript engine that runs our code for us. JavaScript allows us to dynamically generate HTML and CSS based on predetermined conditions or user input.

For the time being we will use JavaScript to write _client_-side code, that is, programs that will only run in the browser. In future units, we will use JavaScript to write applications to be run and deployed on servers.

## Key Topics
* Code comments
* console
* Variables
* Types
* Booleans
* Numbers
* Strings
* Arrays
* Conditional statements
* Equality
* Logical, comparison and ternary operators
* for and while loops
* Functions
* Alerts, confirms, prompts
* Global vs local scope
* Objects

## Comprehension Check
You will be employer-ready if you can answer the following questions:
1. What are five fundamental concepts of programming?
2. What is object-oriented programming?
3. What is a function?


## Learning Objectives
You will be employer-competitive if you are able to:
* Identify and declare variables containing primitive and object data types in JavaScript
* Write for loops to iterate over strings and arrays
* Write conditional statements using if/else and switch
* Explain the importance of objects in JavaScript and create objects containing both properties and methods
* Explain and implement the difference between function declarations and expressions
* Explain and implement comparison and logical operators

## Homework: JavaScript Games

* Create one of two possible computer games: Word Guess or Psychic. These apps will run in the browser, and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by your JavaScript code.
