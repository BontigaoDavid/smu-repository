# Unit 7: Firebase

## Overview

In this unit you will be introduced to the concept of saving, or persisting, user data.

There are two main types of storage we will use to save data:

Client Side Storage: uses cookies, sessionStorage, and localStorage to save and reuse user data across a user’s session.
Server Side Storage: saves user info to a database that can be reused across multiple devices and sessions. We'll use Firebase to accomplish this.
You'll also cover working with Date objects in JavaScript using the Moment.js library. Dates come up often in programming, whether you're building a scheduling application, todo-list, e-commerce app, etc. You'll also use the Moment.js library to do things such as converting between various date formats and finding the difference between two dates.

## Key Topics
* Cookies
* Sessions
* sessionStorage
* localStorage
* Server side storage
* Firebase
* event.preventDefault();
* momentJS
* Handling errors

## Comprehension Check
You will be employer-ready if you can answer the following questions: 
1. What role does a cookie play when saving user data?
2. What is the difference between local and server side storage?
3. What does event.preventDefault() do when executed?

## Learning Objectives
You will be employer-competitive if you are able to:
* Incorporate cookies and sessions into web apps for persistent user experiences.
* Set up Firebase systems to store remote data.
* Build apps that collect user input and save them to the cloud using AJAX in tandem with Firebase’s API.

## Homework

* **Train Time** (Recommended)
In this assignment, you'll create a train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. Your app will retrieve and manipulate this information with Moment.js. This website will provide up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.

* **Multiplayer Rock Paper Scissors** (Challenge)
In this assignment, you'll indeed create another Rock Paper Scissors game. The catch? You're going to make this an online multiplayer game, all with the help of Firebase (and the rest of your web development repertoire)!
