# Unit 11: JS Constructors and Callbacks

## Overview

In this unit, we will discuss JavaScript's brand of OOP by introducing constructors and the prototype chain. Constructors are special functions that are extremely useful in creating objects of similar types. Prototypes are JavaScriptâ€™s built in system, allowing objects to inherit features from other objects. Prototypes are considered by many to be an advanced JavaScript topic and mastering it will be sure to give you an extra edge as a JavaScript developer.

## Key Topics
* Objects
* this
* Callbacks
* Constructors
* Prototypes

## Comprehension Check

You will be employer-ready if you can answer the following questions:
1. What is a constructor function and how would you use one?
2. What is the difference between classical inheritance and prototypal inheritance?

## Learning Objectives
You will be employer-competitive if you are able to:
* Integrate constructor functions into your applications, reducing the amount of code you have to write. 
* Create applications that can scale easily because their objects are dynamically created with constructor functions.

## Homework: Word Guess With Constructors
* In this unit's assignment, you will create a Word Guess command-line game using constructor functions.
