# Unit 4: Intro To jQuery

## Overview
When developers find themselves repeating a task they will often implement a solution to simplify their workflow. We saw earlier that CSS frameworks emerged to ensure consistency across applications and expedite developer workflow. The same is true in the JavaScript ecosystem. 

jQuery is a JavaScript library created to simplify DOM manipulation and event handling. The syntax of jQuery allows us to write few lines of code to accomplish similar ends with vanilla JavaScript. Additionally, jQuery provides a number of methods for animations and working with APIs.

Many will argue that jQuery is slowly being phased out and replaced with front-end frameworks such as React. While you may not discover a lot of job listings for jQuery developers, itâ€™s an important skill to master as the library is still widely used in both new and legacy code.
