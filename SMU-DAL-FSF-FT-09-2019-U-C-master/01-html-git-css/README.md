# Unit 1: Introduction to Web Development, HTML, CSS and Git
## Overview
Congratulations! This is the first step on your journey towards a career in full-stack web development. There are many paths your career can take in this field and this unit is the foundation for all of them. Every full-stack web developer must master HTML and CSS, as well as learn how to program browsers, servers and databases. There are several programming languages available to us to build and deploy full-stack web applications, such as PHP or Python. The language this course will focus on is JavaScript. Weâ€™ll use it to program _both_ the browser, or client, _and_ the server.

Regardless of the programming language, two tools that every developer uses on a daily basis are the **command line** and **version control**. The command line allows developers to quickly and efficiently interface with their operating system and software. To begin, we will use the command line to navigate the file tree and create directories and files. In later units, we will use the command line to install software dependencies and run servers, among other tasks. Version control is an approach to managing changes in files without the need to make multiple copies of those files. We will be learning **Git**, which is the most popular version control system. Git integrates with **GitHub.com**, a site for developers to host and share their code. We will be deploying our first web site through **GitHub Pages**.

The first, and perhaps most important, file we will create is `index.html`. It is the default entry point for any web application. All of our subsequent work will build on this initial starting point. The file suffix `.html` refers to **HTML**, or **Hyper-Text Markup Language**. HTML allows us to apply document formatting to text in a similar fashion to any word-processor. The biggest difference between HTML and a word processor is the ability to link between any document, anywhere in the world. This is the _hyper-text_ of HTML.

While HTML is enough to create a simple website, it will be a bit flat. We will add color, fonts, and element positioning using **CSS**, or **Cascading Style Sheets**, to our HTML files to make them visually dynamic. In the next unit we will learn CSS frameworks which will expedite our development process.

Subsequent units will build on this foundation of HTML, CSS and version control as we add JavaScript, servers and databases to our stack to build interactive web applications.

## Key Topics

## Comprehension Check
You will be employer-ready if you can answer the following questions:
1. What does it mean to be a full-stack web developer?
2. What is the relationship between HTML and CSS?
3. What is git workflow?

## Learning Objectives
You will be employer-competitive if you are able to:
* Build and style static web pages with semantic HTML & CSS
* Implement best practices and standards when structuring HTML files using nested elements, indentation, comments, and line breaks
* Implement CSS styling via class, id and element selectors using external stylesheets, inline styles and embedded style tags
* Explain the _cascade_ in Cascading Style Sheets and implement the box model for HTML elements
* Explain the value of version-control and utilize git workflow to initialize projects, track changes and host via remote server
* Perform common commands via the command line to interface with the operating system, such as navigating the file tree and creating and deleting files and directories
* Execute live deployment using GitHub Pages

## Homework
* **Build Your Portfolio Page** (Recommended Homework): You will use your newly acquired web development skills to build a simple static site with HTML and CSS. You will take your site live by deploying it to GitHub Pages.

* **Build A Wireframe Layout** (Easier Homework): You will build a web design skeleton using HTML/CSS.
